_Restaurants at your fingertips!_

### The Inspiration
_The inspiration came from an idea to build a home page for a **fictional coffee shop.** By brainstorming a little more, came a **"restaurants near me"** demo._
### The Product
_This single-page website is an interactive demo based on the **concept of "finding restaurants near me".** A certain variety of food items is arranged inside the demo. You may click on any item, and a **list of restaurants** serving that item, appears below!_
### The Process
_The website was programmed on **Visual Studio Code** using HTML and CSS languages. Image assets were borrowed for the sake of the demo, from Google._
### The Challenges
_As a beginner, it was challenging to code entirely from scratch due to **lack of knowledge** of CSS features, or encountering **mis-alignment** of HTML elements. Therefore, **minimal help** of AI-assistants was considered to rectify minor bugs._
### The Journey
_This project took a total of **three days** to complete. Multiple learnings were also embraced along the journey of making this website._
